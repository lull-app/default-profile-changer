# Default Profile Changer

**A simple Stream Deck plugin to easily switch your default profile â€” with one button press.**


## âœ¨ What is Default Profile Changer?

Default Profile Changer solves a small but annoying problem:  
Normally, Stream Deck automatically switches profiles based on active applications.  
But sometimes, you just want to **manually set** your **default profile** â€” easily and quickly.

This plugin adds a **button** that lets you set any profile as the default, without diving into menus.


## ðŸš€ How it Works

- Select the profile you want to set as default.
- Press the button.
- Your Stream Deck updates the default profile instantly (with a quick Stream Deck reload).

Fast, simple!


## ðŸ”§ Usage

- Simply add the **Default Profile Changer** action to any button on your Stream Deck.
- Click the button to switch your default profile.


## ðŸ“¦ Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lull-app/default-profile-changer.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development environment:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will:
- Watch and rebuild the plugin and server automatically.
- Restart the Stream Deck plugin for easy testing.
